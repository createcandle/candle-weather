# candle-weather

A simple weather prediction addon that uses data from the World Meteorological Organization. This is a non-commercial source, which is likely to offer better protection against profiling. It also removes the need to deal with API keys, and the WMO API is public. You can set how often it requests fresh data, with the default being once an hour.

It creates two things. The first one shows today's weather:

The second thing shows a prediction for tomorrow:

## Integrations

VoCo voice control has some optimizations for this addon. If you ask for todays values it will skip the sunrise and sunset values.

The photoframe addon will detect this addon's thing an use it to show the current weather on the screensaver.
